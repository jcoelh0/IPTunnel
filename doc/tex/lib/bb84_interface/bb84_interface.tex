This project is built in c# and it runs only in Windows. It's made to connect IP Tunnel with the BB84 with an easy to use interface.
\par
It's composed by the main screen where it shows the bits that are being sent over and some other information along side with a refresh rate option. It also features two other configuration screens, one to change the remote ip address and TCP port and the other to watch the protocol configuration while the simulation is occurring.
